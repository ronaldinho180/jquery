Homework

I want you to create your own fadeSlideToggle() method that will combine the functionality of slideToggle and fadeToggle. You may not reference either of these methods directly, instead you'll user animate().

hint: jQuery allows you to pass the string "toggle", as a value for height and opacity.

when finished, the method should be called, like so: 
$('#box').fadeSlideToggle();
